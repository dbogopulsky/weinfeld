      <description>This Shabbos is referred to as Shabbos Breishis, as opposed to other Shabbosos that we call it Shabbos Parshas Noach and the like. The Gemara in Baba Basra 121a actually refers to every Shabbos as “Shabbos Breishis” in the context that Shabbos does not require Kiddush Beis Din as opposed to the holidays of the year. However, the Minhag Yisrael is to refer to this Shabbos in particular as Shabbos Breishis which would seem to imply that that with this Shabbos we are beginning something new.</description>

      <description>There are some Parshiyos that begin with listing of children of a person such as Parshas Toldos, but the Parshah is called Toldos. As opposed to Parshas Noach, it begins with אלה תולדות נח, but the Parshah is still called Noach and not Toldos. One could say because Noach was 500 years old when he began to have children so he was already well known for who he was and he didn’t have to be known by his children.</description>
